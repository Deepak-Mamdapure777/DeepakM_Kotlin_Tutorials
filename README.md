# Why learn Kotlin ?
I like Kotlin a very much as similar to Java. its a very successfull typed programming language and it saved our lot of time to write boilerplate code in development lifecycle. Before going to see what are the key feature Kotlin introduced in there introductory part.
we can go through with Kotlin Intial Born Part.

Kotlin is a statically-typed programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine and also can be compiled to JavaScript source code or uses the LLVM compiler infrastructure. Its primary development is from a team of JetBrains programmers based in Saint Petersburg, Russia. While the syntax is not compatible with Java, Kotlin is designed to interoperate with Java code and is reliant on Java code from the existing Java Class Library, such as the collections framework.

The name comes from Kotlin Island, near St. Petersburg. Andrey Breslav mentioned that the team decided to name it after an island just like Java was named after the Indonesian island of Java.

History

In July 2011 JetBrains unveiled Project Kotlin, a new language for the JVM, which had been under development for a year.JetBrains lead Dmitry Jemerov said that most languages did not have the features they were looking for, with the exception of Scala. However, he cited the slow compile time of Scala as an obvious deficiency.One of the stated goals of Kotlin is to compile as quickly as Java. In February 2012, JetBrains open sourced the project under the Apache 2 license.

JetBrains hopes that the new language will drive IntelliJ IDEA sales.

Kotlin v1.0 was released on February 15, 2016.This is considered to be the first officially stable release and JetBrains has committed to long-term backwards compatibility starting with this version.

# At Google I/O 2017, Google announced first-class support for Kotlin on Android.
